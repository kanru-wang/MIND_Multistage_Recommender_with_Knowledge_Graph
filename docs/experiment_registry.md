# Experiment Registry

This registry names the split protocol behind each major result set. Use it before comparing metrics: runs are only comparable when their validation protocol is the same.

## Result Sets

| Label | Protocol | Reference | Config | Processed data | Run artifacts | Primary eval file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small dev split | Train on all `MINDsmall_train`; split `MINDsmall_dev` by time into Small Val and Small Test. | Commit `ad1fd9b6af3c28da7c5add090a93eb8a045d5bf3` | `configs/mind_small.yaml` | `data/processed/MINDsmall` | `runs/mind_small_demo` | `runs/mind_small_demo/eval/ranker_eval_test.json` |
| Large dev only | Train on all `MINDlarge_train`; validate on official `MINDlarge_dev` only, Nov 15. | Commit `b83a9308123fa196cf6be627762f01845545b123` | `configs/mind_large_tune.yaml` | `data/processed/MINDlarge_tune` | `runs/mind_large_tune` | `runs/mind_large_tune/eval/ranker_eval_val.json` |
| Large temporal | Train on `MINDlarge_train` before Nov 14; validate on Nov 14 tail from `MINDlarge_train` plus all `MINDlarge_dev`. | Current repo | `configs/mind_large_temporal_tune.yaml` | `data/processed/MINDlarge_temporal_tune` | `runs/mind_large_temporal_tune` | `runs/mind_large_temporal_tune/eval/ranker_eval_val.json` |
| Small temporal | Train on `MINDsmall_train` before Nov 14; validate on Nov 14 tail from `MINDsmall_train` plus all `MINDsmall_dev`. | Current repo | `configs/mind_small_temporal_tune.yaml` | `data/processed/MINDsmall_temporal_tune` | `runs/mind_small_temporal_tune` | `runs/mind_small_temporal_tune/eval/ranker_eval_val.json` |

## Current Metrics

Values below were read from the listed local evaluation artifacts on 2026-06-29.
They describe completed runs, not untrained working-tree configuration changes.

| Label | Eval split | Impressions | Teacher best epoch | Ranker best epoch | AUC | MRR | nDCG@5 | nDCG@10 |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Small dev split | test | 14,631 | 2 | 5 | 0.6619 | 0.3589 | 0.3463 | 0.4050 |
| Large dev only | val | 376,471 | 2 | 1 | 0.6686 | 0.3313 | 0.3659 | 0.4252 |
| Large temporal | val | 807,988 | 4 | 2 | 0.6538 | 0.3050 | 0.3332 | 0.3952 |
| Small temporal | val | 103,422 | 1 | 3 | 0.6297 | 0.2995 | 0.3263 | 0.3867 |

## Sanity Rules

- For temporal configs, `preprocess_meta.json:n_validation_eval_impressions` must equal `ranker_eval_val.json:n_impressions`.
- The older Small dev split is a historical demo result, not the current architecture-search baseline.
- Use Small temporal for fast architecture experiments.
- Use Large temporal to confirm promising architecture settings before final submission training.
- Use `configs/mind_large_submission.yaml` only after choosing fixed settings; it trains on `MINDlarge_train + MINDlarge_dev` and writes hidden-test submission ranks.

## Known Metadata Note

`data/processed/MINDlarge_temporal_tune/preprocess_meta.json` may show the older internal mode name `leaderboard_temporal_tune` if it was generated before the config was renamed to `temporal_tune`. The directory name, split counts, and eval file identify the intended Large temporal protocol. Rerunning preprocess with the current config refreshes the mode string.
